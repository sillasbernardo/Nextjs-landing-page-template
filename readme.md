# Reactjs Website Project

## Overview

This is a freelancing website model which was primarily designed for a client operating in event planning industry, with a particular focus on providing high-quality lighting services.

To create this website, I used several technologies including React, NodeJs and Cloudinary. These technologies were chosen for their ability to provide a fast, responsive user experience, as well as flexibility and scalability. I also incorporated Sass, several React tools and  React Lazy Loading to enhance the functionality and performance of the website.

In the following sections, I`ll dive deeper into the features and functionalities of the website, and provide instructions on how to use them. I hope you find this website to be valuable resource for your needs, and any feeback or questions are welcome.
